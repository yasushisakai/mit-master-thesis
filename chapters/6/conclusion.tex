\section{Future Work}

\subsection{collective urban planning tool kit}

While it will be useful to have a general app that goes beyond reporting
but enables users to propose an intervention, there is a risk that it is
hard to maintain the attention for one mobile app. An alternative is to
create a framework of the app, which can be customized to specific targets
similar to bike lane security and topics discussed in the DISCUSSION
section.

Recent web application development have focused on how to handle and create modular parts
to make it easy to reuse and distribute. We can observe this by NPM (Node
    Package Manager; A software that automates dependency checking and
    installing parts of software to be used in combination.) Having more than
475,000\footnote{https://www.npmjs.com/} building blocks that one can
combine to make web based applications. The elements of one application is
modular as well, were one application are components combined together.


\subsection{safer route navigation}
Utilizing the data collected by the users, we can make a routing system based on safeness within the roads.

Modern map services enables custom path finding, where applications can set
different weights for each road segment. Improving the overall bike
experience will introduce people to ride their bikes more frequently,
causing fewer cars.
The ring bell Geo location data having weights good and bad, the paths can alter to take a safer route. This will incentives the users for using the app.
In addition, the reported data can be sourced to car navigation systems to let car drivers notice places that are bike heavy.

\subsection{inclusive design for non-bikers}

This app had focused on bikers, and did not take into account people who use other modes of transportation, such as pedestrians or car drivers. It is important to incorporate input from diverse people, and this both applies to the analytical and synthetic phase. It is easy to imagine to discuss the prioritization side, but the data on on-bike reports be should capture in a simulated environment.
Using a VR headset can simulate the bike ride and solicit data from people using a virtual environment projecting recorded material of one commute.

\subsection{Incentivasation}
Shirkey has mentioned the internet have lowern There are two kinds of value mechanisms in a collective action. \cite{shirky2010cognitive}
distributed donation matching system \\
method for periodic participation - donation matching system \\
% combining for post / pre natural / artificial disasters
\subsection {update infrastructure for autonomous vehicles}
use this renovation opportunity for making cities compatible with autonomous vehicles (PEV)
\subsection{Headphones w/ noise cancellation for collecting sound from both
sides}
% TODO: incomplete
\subsection{Holacracy and liquid democracy}
% TODO: incomplete
