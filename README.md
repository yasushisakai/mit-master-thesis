# tufte-latex-mit

This is a custom version of [MIT's LaTeX thesis template](http://web.mit.edu/thesis/tex/) integrated with the [Tufte-LaTeX] (https://tufte-latex.github.io/tufte-latex/) template.  

It will make your thesis/dissertation look much nicer than the default MIT template.  That being said, there are probably some things that are broken that you are welcome to fix.  Just press enter when you TeX the files and ignore those pesky error messages...

Check out main.pdf for a preview of what it looks like.
